# Interview Questions: Foundational Skills for DLL/Flask/Python Work

This repository contains interview questions and solutions designed to assess foundational skills needed for co-op positions involving DLL integration, Flask API development, and Python programming.

## Overview

These questions test problem-solving, APIs, data structures, and debugging skills that transfer directly to DLL integration work. They are structured to evaluate candidates at different experience levels (junior to advanced co-op).

## Repository Structure

### 📁 third_party_library/
- **Question**: API Wrapper Design (20 minutes)
- **Focus**: API design, error handling, input validation, abstraction

  - [solution.py](third_party_library/solution.py) - Robust calculator wrapper implementation
  - [hidden_api.py](third_party_library/hidden_api.py) - External calculator interface stub

### 📁 flask/
- **Question**: Simple REST API (25 minutes)
- **Focus**: Flask basics, RESTful design, state management, JSON handling
- **Files**:
  - [README.md](api_wrapper/flask/README.md) - Question details and evaluation criteria
  - [solution.py](api_wrapper/flask/solution.py) - Complete Flask counter API implementation

### 📁 leetcode/
Directory reserved for LeetCode-style algorithmic problems (currently empty).

## Interview Questions Covered

1. **API Wrapper Design** - Creating clean interfaces over clunky third-party libraries
2. **Data Type Conversion** - Binary data handling with struct packing/unpacking
3. **Simple REST API** - Flask API development with proper HTTP methods and error handling
4. **Error Handling & Debugging** - Retry logic, logging, and custom exceptions
5. **Callback Pattern** - Asynchronous event handling and error isolation
6. **State Management** - Resource tracking and state machine logic

## Assessment Framework

### Junior Co-op (1st/2nd year)
- Basic Python functions and classes
- Simple error handling
- Flask endpoints
- Following instructions

### Intermediate Co-op (2nd/3rd year)
- Clean API design
- Proper error handling with custom exceptions
- State management
- Binary data manipulation
- REST APIs with proper status codes

### Advanced Co-op (3rd/4th year)
- Production-ready APIs
- Concurrency considerations
- Retry logic with backoff
- Async patterns and callbacks
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Key Evaluation Criteria

**Must Have:**
- Working solutions
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Error handling
- Input validation

**Nice to Have:**
- Retry logic
- Logging
- Documentation
- Thread safety considerations

## Getting Started

Each question directory contains:
- Detailed problem statement
- Implementation requirements
- Solution examples
- Evaluation criteria

Use these materials to practice for co-op interviews or to evaluate candidates for positions involving Python, Flask, and systems integration work.
